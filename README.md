# Data Engineering Examples
This repository uses Google Colab for different Data Engineering Projects. Running the scripts in Google Colab ensures a more elegant displaying of intermediate results

**Note:** The Projects are uploaded in a Ipython Notebook format and are designed to be usable as cheatsheats (hence the sometimes very detailed comment blocks)
